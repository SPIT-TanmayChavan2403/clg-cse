## Steps to run the project locally:
- Open command prompt (or terminal) and change the current working directory to location where you want to clone the repository.
- Then type: **git clone {repo-name}** and press Enter.
- If the clone was successfully completed then a new sub directory may appear with the same name as the repository.
- In terminal, now change the currently directory to the new sub directory.
- Then type **npm install**. This installs all the dependencies required to run the project.
- To run the project, type **npm run start**.
